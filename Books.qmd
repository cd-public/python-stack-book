# Quarto Books and GitHub Pages

### Search Engine

1. Search "Quarto Books"
2. Go to [https://quarto.org/docs/books/](https://quarto.org/docs/books/)

### At the Terminal

1. Created a folder called "work".
2. I ran the following in the terminal:

```{.email filename="Terminal"}
quarto create project book mybook
```
3. I will be prompted for a title
    -   I used "Python Stack"
4. I will be prompted if I want to open in `vscode`
    -   I accepted.

### In VS Code

1. Generating the book project automatically generated a `_quarto.yml` file.

```{.yml filename="_quarto.yml"}
project:
  type: book

book:
  title: "mybook"
  author: "Jane Doe"
  date: "8/18/2021"
  chapters:
    - index.qmd
    - intro.qmd
    - summary.qmd
    - references.qmd

bibliography: references.bib

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
  pdf:
    documentclass: scrreprt
  epub:
    cover-image: cover.png
```

2. I updated the file to be as follows, with only two chapters:

```{.yml filename="_quarto.yml"}
project:
  type: book

book:
  title: "Python Stack"
  author: "Prof. Calvin"
  date: "1/9/2025"
  chapters:
    - index.qmd
    - VSCode.qmd
    - Books.qmd

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
  pdf:
    documentclass: scrreprt
```

### Creating Content

1. I view the initial book by opening a .qmd file and using `Preview`
    -   By default on Windows, `Crtl+Shift+K`
2. I include some content in my new .qmd files.
    -   For me, this was a prior lecture "Python, VS Code, Quarto"
    -   For me, this was *this* .qmd on books & pages.
3. I use a full `render` after creating content to ensure everything is up-to-date.

```{.email filename="Terminal"}
quarto render
```
